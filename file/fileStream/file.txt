There is a third consideration which will also tend to warn us against loss of time. Our life is a brief span measuring some sixty or seventy years in all, but nearly one half of this has to be spent in sleep; some years have to be spent over our meals; some over dressing and undressing; some in making journeys on land and voyages by sea; some in merry - making, either on our own account or for the sake of others; some in celebrating religious and social festivities; some in watching over the sick - beds of our nearest and dearest relatives.
The love of beauty is an essential part of all healthy human nature. It is a moral quality. The absence of it is not an assured ground of condemnation, but the presence of it is an invariable sign of goodness of heart. In proportion to the degree in which it is felt will probably be the degree in which nobleness and beauty of character will be attained.
Excessive daytime drowsiness in older adults may predict a significantly increased risk of stroke, said researchers reporting data on Thursday at the International Stroke Conference in New Orleans.
Most people have, from time to time, unintentionally dozed off on the couch watching television or reading a book or even stopped in traffic while driving. But persistent drowsiness during the day usually signals a chronic sleep deficit, and bigger problems. The new study found that people who suffered from "significant dozing" — those who almost always fell asleep involuntarily during the day — were 4.5 times more likely to have a stroke than people in the "no dozing" group. The association between sleepiness and stroke was: the sleepier the person, the higher the risk of stroke.
